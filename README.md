# MLOps-Fraud-Detection-using-Pycaret_MLFlow

 PyCaret is a low-code machine learning library that allows you to quickly build and train models, while MLflow provides a robust platform for managing the entire machine learning lifecycle.
 Together, these tools make it easy to develop and deploy fraud detection models with confidence. By using PyCaret's built-in functionalities for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and hyperparameter tuning, you can quickly build high-performing models that are optimized for fraud detection. And with MLflow's tracking and versioning capabilities, you can easily manage your experiments, reproduce your results, and collaborate with your team.
